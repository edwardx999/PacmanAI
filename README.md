# PacmanAI

TASKS:
- Train and see if the agent improves.  We should show at least some skill being developed for our Milestone report.
- Easier running from command line.  I could see the following being useful:
    - Train mode: Takes in a generation count for how many generations of optimization to run.  Also takes flags for whether or not to load a previous agent as the base of the population or start from scratch and whether/where to save the final best agent.
    - Observe mode: Runs optimization same as training, but uses the GUI to show progress of evolution maybe every 10 generations if fitness improves
    - Battle Mode: Runs a game with one agent loaded from our training and the user playing with keys against that agent
